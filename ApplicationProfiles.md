# Application Profiles for the IDS Information Model

This work has been carried out in the scope of the [Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence Cognitive Internet Technologies](https://www.cit.fraunhofer.de/), [Research Center Data Spaces](https://www.dataspaces.fraunhofer.de/), project T66.

This document presents design and implementation of a core application profile (AP) for the IDS Information Model that maximize interoperability with widely-used (quasi-)standards like the DCAT-AP.
It additionally suggests methods to utilize and extend the IDS AP for custom use-cases or domains.
