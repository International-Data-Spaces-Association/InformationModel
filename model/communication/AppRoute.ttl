    ids:AppRoute describes the communication between data apps (such as in a data processing pipeline) inside an IDS Connector.
    An ids:AppRoute consist of multiple app endpoints which exchange data. The communication pipeline between two adjacent data apps is represented by the ids:RouteStep class.
    ids:AppRoute also holds the information about the app endpoints, which are at the start and end of the whole processing pipeline.

Rationale: whereas an ids:Endpoint can have an ids:endpointArtifact, it is additionally important that the data flow inside the ids:Connector / ids:ConfigurationModel is aware of the ids:ContractOffer (a property of ids:Resource!) associated with the data coming into the Connector or going out of the Connector.
Use: Whenever properties of this Resource change, it may make sense to notify the ids:broker(s) configured for this AppRoute.
Note: In an ids:AppRoute that is the sequence of multiple ids:RouteSteps, the output resource of one step serves immediately as the input that is processed by the subsequent step(s).  An ids:SystemAdapter typically does not change the ids:Resource, but might rather make it available in a different ids:Representation.  An ids:SmartApp might replate its input(s) by an entirely different (e.g., fused) resource.
