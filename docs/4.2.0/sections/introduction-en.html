                                                            The Information Model primarily aims at describing, publishing and detecting data products (Data Assets) and reusable data processing software (Data Apps) in the Industrial Data Space. Data Assets and Data Apps are the core resources of the Industrial Data Space, and are hereinafter referred to as
                                                            <em>resources</em>
                                                            . By means of a structured semantic annotation it is ensured only relevant resources are provided (i.e., resources appropriate to meet the requirements of the Data Consumer). Once the resources are identified, they can be exchanged and consumed via semantically defined service interfaces and protocol bindings in an automated way. Apart from those core commodities, the Information Model describes essential properties of Industrial Data Space entities, its participants, its infrastructure components, and its processes.

                                                            The Information Model is a generic model, with no commitment to any particular domain. Domain modeling is delegated to shared vocabularies and data schemata, as provided e.g. by domain-specific communities of the Industrial Data Space. The Information Model does not provide a
                                                            <em>meta-model</em>
                                                             for defining custom structured datatypes comparable to the OData or OPC-UA standards. Considerations beyond the scope of modeling digital assets and their interchange are considered out-of-scope. The Information Model does not deal with the
                                                            <em>side effects</em>
                                                             of data exchange (on Data Consumer&#39;s side), for example in scenarios where data is used for real-time machine control. RPC (remote procedure call) semantics of data messages is also not covered by the Information Model.
