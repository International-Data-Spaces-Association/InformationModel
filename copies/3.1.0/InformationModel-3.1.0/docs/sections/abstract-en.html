<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Information Model defines a domain-agnostic lingua franca of the Industrial Data Space. It constitutes a central agreement shared by its participants and components, facilitating compatibility and interoperability. The Information Model primarily aims at the description, publication and discovery of data products and data processing software within the Industrial Data Space. A structured, semantic annotation ensures the provision of the most relevant assets, appropriate for a client's task. Once identified, the Information Model enables automated consumption of those offerings via service interface and protocol binding definitions. Next to those core assets, the Information Model further describes essential properties of Industrial Data Space entities, its participants, infrastructure components and processes.</span>
