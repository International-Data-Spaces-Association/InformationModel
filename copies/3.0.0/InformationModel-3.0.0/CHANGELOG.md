# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [3.0.0] 2020-03-04
Version 3.0.0 of the IDS Information model

### Added

* Request- and ResponseMessages for the ParIS service.

* Revised Usage Control model based on the [Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/)

* Templates for Usage Control using the [SPARQL Inferencing Notation (SPIN)](https://www.w3.org/Submission/spin-overview/)

* New Connector property `ids:hasAgents`. A Connector can now publish its agents as part of the self-description.

* [RDF validation with SHACL](examples/rdf-validation-using-shacl) documentation with examples using CLI tools and the Apache Jena Framework for Java.

* [Perl script](utils/rdf_void_annotation.pl) as an example for extracting metadata from RDF data resources using the [Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/void/) ontology.


### Changed

* Redesign of the DynamicAttributeToken (DAT) based on the new Dynamic Attribute Provisioning Service (DAPS) version. Check the corresponding [Token](model/security/Token.ttl) class as well as the [DAT payload example](examples/DATPayload.jsonlod) for more information.

* `ids:RequestMessage`, `ids:ResponseMessage`, `ids:NotificationMessage` not _abstract_ any more. These messages can now be used directly for non-core IDS communication.

* `ids:DescriptionRequestMessage`(previously called `ids:SelfDescriptionRequest`) now accepts an optional URI. This can be used to either retrieve a component's self-description (by providing its own URI or nothing) or to retrieve metadata about a specific element by providing the element's URI.

* Renamed some existing `ids:Message`s. Check the [Documentation Table of the ids:Message taxonomy](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/IndustrialDataSpace/InformationModel/blob/feature/message_taxonomy_description/model/communication/Message_Description.htm) for the current naming.

### Fixed

* `ids:Message` now correctly labelled as _abstract_ since it is not intended to be used directly.

## [2.1.0] 2019-12-02
Version 2.1.0 of the IDS Information model

### Added

* New class *ids:VocabularyData*. Partial mapping of the [Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/void/) in the IDS Information Model. It can be used to reference domain-specific vocabularies and terminologies.

* New class *ids:DescribedSemantically*. Superclass of *ids:Resource* and *ids:Representation*. *ids:DescribedSemantically* introduces two new properties:
    - *ids:domainVocabulary* with range *ids:VocabularyData*. Allows using instances of class *ids:VocabularyData* to reference domain-specific terminologies used in *ids:Resource* /  *ids:Representation* .
    - *ids:shapesGraph* (an import of *[sh:shapesGraph](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#sh-shapes-graph)*) with range *xsd:anyURI*. URI should refer to an RDF graph containing SHACL shapes, which describes the domain-specific semantics of a Resource / Representation.

* Travis CI script for validating correctness of Turtle files in Pull Requests.

* SHACL Shapes for the new RDF classes and properties.

* Example of *ids:Resource* (in JSON-LD and RDF/TTL) and corresponding SHACL shapes to describe (temperature) sensor data with domain-specific semantics. Example and README can be found in the /*examples/domain-specific semantics using SHACL* directory.


## [2.0.1] 2019-11-19
Version 2.0.1 of the IDS Information model

### Changed
* Removed property *ids:baseContractOffer* from class *ids:ContractRequestMessage* due to redundancy. By definition *ids:ContractRequestMessage* already requires a contract in its payload. The property is therefore not needed.

### Fixed
* Changed *ids:referingConnector* (class *ids:Token*) from *owl:ObjectProperty* to *owl:DatatypeProperty* with *rdfs:range* *xsd:anyURI*. Allows to reference the connector via an URI.

* Removed *idsm:abstract true* property from *ids:variant* (class *ids:Resource*). Property is invalid, since it is intended to be used by classes only. 

* Minor typo fixes.


## [2.0.0] 2019-10-14
Version 2.0 of the IDS Information model


### Added
- ids:DynamicAttributeToken, subclass of ids:Token
- ids:ParIS
- Additional SHACL Shapes for schema validation
- ids:contentVersion property. Version identifier for ids:Message payload, indicates the version of the description of the information in the payload.


### Changed
 * Connector is now subClass of InfrastructureComponent (Broker, ParIS, DAPS, IP, AppStore)

 * ids:SecurityProfile is now used for pre-defined security profiles. Removed ids:CustomSecurityProfile.

 * Messages: Additional classes / properties for the ids:Message taxonomy to further specify and distinguish different message types
     * Update of notification messages related to (un-)availability and changes of a component or its certification
     * ids:QueryMessage now uses codes for message targets (e.g., BROKER, APPSTORE, ANY) and scopes (ALL, ACTIVE_ONLY, INACTIVE_ONLY)
     * New class ids:ContractSupplementMessage to exchange information to access a resource of a contract
     * New class ids:LogNotification, which is intended for logging messages

 * Policies: LeftOperand, Operator more restrictive.  Additional operands and operators for different constraint types.

 * Reduced namespace: ids_ for core model classes / properties, idsc_ for codes and idsm_ for metamodel classes / properties

### Removed

- Removing plural forms for properties: A catalog can have can have several “ids:offer” triples but must not have any with “ids:offer*s*”
