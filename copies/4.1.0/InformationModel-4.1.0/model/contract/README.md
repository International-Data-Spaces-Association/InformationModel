# Contract Module

Contract Agreements are the result of a `Contract negotiation process`.
Consumers interested in acquiring a Resource are obliged to evaluate
the associated Contract offer and submit a Contract Request containing
a set of applicable rules, optionally modified to meet Consumer's needs
and capabilities. The Provider will in turn respond with an accordingly
adapted Contract Offer (when different) or Contract Agreement (when
semantically equivalent to Contract Request).
