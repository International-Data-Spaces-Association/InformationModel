# Frequently asked questions (FAQ) about the InformationModel.

### What is the relationship of the IDS Information Model to the Gaia-X Federated Secure Data Infrastructure?
Like in the IDS, a key principle of Gaia-X is that participants in an ecosystem and the services they provide describe themselves with machine-comprehensible, standardized metadata. The information model used for that, the so-called Gaia-X Self-Description Schema, has a lot in common with the IDS Information Model, especially when describing concepts that IDS and Gaia-X have in common, e.g., participants, data resources (called “data assets” in Gaia-X), or data apps (related to Gaia-X services). In fact, we are working closely with the Gaia-X community to keep both ontologies aligned.
