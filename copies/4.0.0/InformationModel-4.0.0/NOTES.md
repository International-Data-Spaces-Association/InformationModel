# Questions/issues to discuss

- There is no equivalent of `dcat:Catalog` as a single point of metadata exploration.
  "Connector" as a generic runtime does not seem appropriate match. Such a Catalog
  node might link to advertisements, participants, connectors etc.

- There is no equivalent to `dcat:CatalogRecord` for IDS Resources to indicate e.g.
  when (issued, modified), by whom (contact) the advertisement (offer or request)
  was published. Resources listed in a catalog are implicitly offerings, there is
  no way to supply a request/specify demand for a resource. How do updates of data
  description relate to corresponding catalog record?

## Model / general properties

- Consider versioning properties, e.g. `dcterms:date`
- Consider versioning predicates,  e.g. `adms:prev, adms:next, adms:last, dcterms:isReplacedBy`
- Consider annotation properties, e.g. `dcterms:abstract, dcterms:description`
- Consider use of schema-level constructs to specify abstract content templates
  (see qb:DataStructureDefinition, tabular metadata schema), such a generalized
  structure easies comparisons of instances

## Identification

- What are the entities to be permanently and uniformally identified, e.g. their PID
  must be immutable and constant across catalogs? Examples: Participant, Connector.

## TODOs

- include [integrity constraints](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube#h3_wf-rules), validating resource (SPARQL ASK, SHACL etc.) and prose description
